<p>In this interface you can create and modify Attributes and Types to create new types classes. An
   attribute can be though of as a question.  Types are made of Attributes. New Types can be used as
   attributes in another derived type. For example a book type can have an author type as one of it's
   attributes. The author type may be made of first and last name, title, etc.</p>
