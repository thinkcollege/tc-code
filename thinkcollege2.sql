Frank R.

In this analysis of spending and service practices of state MR/DD agencies, the authors principally assert that despite positive gains made in the expansion of supported employment programs over the past two decades, segregated services continue to outpace the growth of integrated employment. The authors also contend that diverting people and resources at the juncture between high school preparation and their transition to adult roles, such as employment, would be a more realistic plan to promote integrated employment services. Two specific recommendations are offered in relation to this premise: (a) ensuring that all young adults leave high school competitively used or admitted to postsecondary education programs by age 18, and (b) having high schools coordinate post-placement follow-up for 3 years following employment or enrollment in postsecondary education programs.

These efforts have resulted in local school systems (LSS) developing programs and services that are located in the community and on college campuses. Although there is a body of literature on postsecondary opportunities for these students, little is known about the programs and supports provided, or the views of consumers. In an effort to extend the literature, a case-study approach was used to gather information on a program located in a community college. Observations, individual interviews, focus groups, and document reviews were used to address the following: (a) What criteria (i.e., rationale for development, allocation of resources, staffing decisions, admission into program, factors that facilitate or act as barriers to program development and sustainability) are employed in the development and implementation of a public school-sponsored program for students ages 18 to 21 with SD within a community college campus?; (b) What program components described in the literature as best practices for secondary students with significant disabilities are incorporated in this public school-sponsored program located on a community college campus?; and Â© What are the students'' and parents'' views on the role of this public school-sponsored postsecondary program for students with SD ages 18 to 21 in preparing students for the future? Software designed for use in qualitative research was used to sort and code information, and data were triangulated across methods, informants, and analysts. Findings suggest that although the LSS developed and operated the program on a community college campus, students received segregated instruction (e.g., functional academics, social skills, independent living skills) and students had limited interactions with typical college students and limited opportunities for self-determination. However, students and parents were satisfied with the program, and students who exited the program experienced no disruption in services during the transition into the adult services system.

The overall purpose of the larger study is to develop an assessment protocol for inclusive postsecondary education in Canada. We began by examining other approaches to assessment. Three general frameworks exist: first, assessment techniques used for other programs delivered to persons with intellectual disabilities, such as person-centered planning, quality of life assessments or social role valorization. A second approach would arise from tools used to assess undergraduate education generically. This approach could be rooted in measures of student engagement. A third framework would examine inclusive post-secondary education against theories of psychosocial development in young adulthood. None of the existing approaches was entirely appropriate.  The goal of this first phase of the study was to survey the significant groups interested in inclusive post-secondary education to identify what they believed to be important in any assessment. By drawing on the three assessment traditions found in the literature and using a methodology based on grounded theory, we conducted 27 interviews with 5 different groups with direct interests in inclusive post-secondary initiatives in British Columbia: students, faculty, inclusion facilitators, campus staff, and parents. The qualitative data indicated two spheres of analysis: first, a consensus about components of successful inclusive postsecondary education, and second a tension between specific dimensions by particular groups and overarching themes that cut across particular groups. At least three groups identified the following five components of inclusive postsecondary education: confidence, student engagement, impact on the classroom or institution, individualized paths and autonomy, and authenticity.  While each group had its own perspective, there was a shared attention to larger concerns for persons with intellectual disabilities, most importantly the nature of support required for successful inclusion and an acknowledgement that full inclusion is a challenging, often anxiety-producing process.

Changes also are described for youth with disabilities who differed in their school-exit status, age, gender, household income, and race/ethnicity. Findings: By 2003 there were significant increases in youth with disabilities'' postsecondary education enrollment and employment rates. There also was an increase in participation in organized community groups. Despite the positive changes, other changes were disconcerting: the sizable increase in the proportion of youth with disabilities who had been fired from a job or arrested. In addition, there was no real change in earnings over time when wages were adjusted for inflation. There were differential changes in outcomes across disability categories, continued limitations for youth from households with lower income, and decreasing but persistent racial/ethnic differences. Conclusion: The age groups included in NLTS and NLTS2 and the timing of data collection in the two studies permit one more comparison between youth with disabilities represented in the two studies--when youth were ages 18 through 21 and had been out of high school up to 4 years.

Another major finding was that the university appeared to serve as a transitioning environment for these students by fostering learning, identity development, and maturity, preparing them for the adult world of work. A limitation noted with the study was that it lacked a series of interviews that may have been helpful in establishing rapport and minimizing problems relating to the participants'' memory deficits.

Frank R. Rusch and David Braddock, in their article "Adult Day Programs Versus Supported Employment (1988-2002): Spending and Service Practices of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities State Agencies (MR/DD)", offer an important analysis of supported employment trends in the United States over the period 1988 through 2002. In this analysis of spending and service practices of state MR/DD agencies, the authors principally assert that despite positive gains made in the expansion of supported employment programs over the past two decades, segregated services continue to outpace the growth of integrated employment. The authors also contend that diverting people and resources at the juncture between high school preparation and their transition to adult roles, such as employment, would be a more realistic plan to promote integrated employment services. Two specific recommendations are offered in relation to this premise: (a) ensuring that all young adults leave high school competitively used or admitted to postsecondary education programs by age 18, and (b) having high schools coordinate post-placement follow-up for 3 years following employment or enrollment in postsecondary education programs.

These efforts have resulted in local school systems (LSS) developing programs and services that are located in the community and on college campuses. Although there is a body of literature on postsecondary opportunities for these students, little is known about the programs and supports provided, or the views of consumers. In an effort to extend the literature, a case-study approach was used to gather information on a program located in a community college. Observations, individual interviews, focus groups, and document reviews were used to address the following: (a) What criteria (i.e., rationale for development, allocation of resources, staffing decisions, admission into program, factors that facilitate or act as barriers to program development and sustainability) are employed in the development and implementation of a public school-sponsored program for students ages 18 to 21 with SD within a community college campus?; (b) What program components described in the literature as best practices for secondary students with significant disabilities are incorporated in this public school-sponsored program located on a community college campus?; and Â© What are the students'' and parents'' views on the role of this public school-sponsored postsecondary program for students with SD ages 18 to 21 in preparing students for the future? Software designed for use in qualitative research was used to sort and code information, and data were triangulated across methods, informants, and analysts. Findings suggest that although the LSS developed and operated the program on a community college campus, students received segregated instruction (e.g., functional academics, social skills, independent living skills) and students had limited interactions with typical college students and limited opportunities for self-determination. However, students and parents were satisfied with the program, and students who exited the program experienced no disruption in services during the transition into the adult services system.

Three general frameworks exist: first, assessment techniques used for other programs delivered to persons with intellectual disabilities, such as person-centered planning, quality of life assessments or social role valorization. A second approach would arise from tools used to assess undergraduate education generically. This approach could be rooted in measures of student engagement. A third framework would examine inclusive post-secondary education against theories of psychosocial development in young adulthood. None of the existing approaches was entirely appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this first phase of the study was to survey the significant groups interested in inclusive post-secondary education to identify what they believed to be important in any assessment. By drawing on the three assessment traditions found in the literature and using a methodology based on grounded theory, we conducted 27 interviews with 5 different groups with direct interests in inclusive post-secondary initiatives in British Columbia: students, faculty, inclusion facilitators, campus staff, and parents. The qualitative data indicated two spheres of analysis: first, a consensus about components of successful inclusive postsecondary education, and second a tension between specific dimensions by particular groups and overarching themes that cut across particular\r\ngroups. At least three groups identified the following five components of inclusive postsecondary education: confidence, student engagement, impact on the classroom or institution, individualized paths and autonomy, and authenticity.\r\n\r\nWhile each group had its own perspective, there was a shared attention to larger concerns for persons with intellectual disabilities, most importantly the nature of support required for successful inclusion and an acknowledgement that full inclusion is a challenging, often anxiety-producing process.

Purpose: To assess change between 1987 and 2003 in the early postschool outcomes (i.e. postsecondary enrollment, employment, engagement in the community, living arrangements, and social involvement) of youth with disabilities. Changes also are described for youth with disabilities who differed in their school-exit status, age, gender, household income, and race/ethnicity. Findings: By 2003 there were significant increases in youth with disabilities'' postsecondary education enrollment and employment rates. There also was an increase in participation in organized community groups. Despite the positive changes, other changes were disconcerting: the sizable increase in the proportion of youth with disabilities who had been fired from a job or arrested. In addition, there was no real change in earnings over time when wages were adjusted for inflation. There were differential changes in outcomes across disability categories, continued limitations for youth from households with lower income, and decreasing but persistent racial/ethnic differences. Conclusion: The age groups included in NLTS and NLTS2 and the timing of data collection in the two studies permit one more comparison between youth with disabilities represented in the two studies--when youth were ages 18 through 21 and had been out of high school up to 4 years.

The enquiry centered on the question: What is the student''s perspective of his or her university experience while attending an IPSE program? Data was analyzed thematically and this resulted in the isolation of five themes: fear and hanging on, "I can make friends, too," the road to belonging, "I have choices," and better hopes and dreams. A main finding was that students were able to give trustworthy accounts of their university experiences. Another major finding was that the university appeared to serve as a transitioning environment for these students by fostering learning, identity development, and maturity, preparing them for the adult world of work. A limitation noted with the study was that it lacked a series of interviews that may have been helpful in establishing rapport and minimizing problems relating to the participants'' memory deficits.
